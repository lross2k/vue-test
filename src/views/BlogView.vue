    <h1> I wanted to make a blog since long time ago</h1>

    <p>What tech stack	should I use? I'm tired	of using React,	Jekyll doesn't seem that cool to me, vanilla JS is nice but I don't have that much free time, what about Svelte or Vue?</p>

    <p>Well, Svelte sounds cool, but in the terrible case that	I needed job as	frontend developer, I think Vue gives me more validity</p>

    <h2>Installing Vue</h2>
    <p>I needed to install node, for that apparently it's recommended to use nvm, which actually did install node really fast on my system</p>

    <p>The vue	installer asked	many questions,	I said yes to a lot of them, which maybe will leave my computer with no disk space remaining,	but there was only one way to find out</p>

    <p>It installed really fast actually, I'm impressed, now it's time	to quickly learn how to	do a half decent Vue landing page </p>
